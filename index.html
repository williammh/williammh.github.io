    <h1>William M Huynh</h1>
    <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a self-taught software engineer who earned my place through grit, not grades—vetted by big tech and placed alongside peers from elite institutions and others, like me, who took a different path and proved we belonged. Ironically, most of what we ended up doing was applying basic computer science—the kind of stuff you can learn on your own with enough personal drive and caffeine. Today, I've grown beyond simply meeting the basics and chasing buzzwords.
    </p>
    <h3>Preferred tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OS:</strong> Debian Linux with KDE Plasma desktop environment</li>
      <li><strong>Primary Editor:</strong> VSCode for rapid development—an influence from my background in web</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Dev:</strong> Kitty paired with Neovim for reliability and performance</li>
      <li><strong>AI:</strong> Varied and used when appropriate to speed up workflow; ran locally when privacy or usage limits matter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm single, with no kids—my code is my baby.
